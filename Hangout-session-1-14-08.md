1. Weekly catch-up time/day

	Text document in Github for updating what we've done? 
	Google Drive for sharing links, contact info etc. 
	Or weekly Hangout session? Evenings around 20.30.

2. Wireframe - website requirements?
	
	Is this an open source project? Will participants have to add code for images and links to their own projects, so it will be updated later?

	Timeline format? This might need Javascript! 

	Flipcard format - we can first make the basic outline using the flipcards and later add interactivity with a timeline. 

	Clicking on the flipcard takes you directly to the project. 

	Use 'sticky' menu/header? 

	Possible addition - Use Javascript to make flipcards to 'pop' when hovering. 

	Possible intermediate: quickview style popup with info. 

3. Division of tasks

	To get started, we could each make a wireframe with a basic layout for the website. Share, review and decide on a final version. 

4. Resources for learning:
	
	No Bootstrap, we'll use Flexbox/Grid
	Group goal - complete one course on Flexbox/Grid.

	Scrimba
	Treehouse   

	Git and Github resources:
	Udacity
	Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp section on Git

To do:

Get up to speed on Flexbox/Grid
When Pai gets back to us we'll schedule another Hangout to discuss more. Share wireframes! 	
Schedule paired programming sessions
Set up Google Drive
